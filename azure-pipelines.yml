# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: echo Hello, world!
  displayName: 'Run a one-line script'

- script: |
    echo Add other tasks to build, test, and deploy your project.
    echo See https://aka.ms/yaml
  displayName: 'Run a multi-line script'
  
# Create a variable
- bash: |
    echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=sauce]crushed tomatoes"

# Use the variable
# "$(sauce)" is replaced by the contents of the `sauce` variable by Azure Pipelines
# before handing the body of the script to the shell.
- bash: |
    echo my pipeline variable is $(sauce)
